# Robust Toxic Content Detection
Code for the paper "Towards Robust Toxic Content Detection".

Please reference `notebooks/jigsaw_data_improvements.ipynb` for experiments in the paper and `notebooks/bert_training_from_scratch.ipynb` for CDAE implementation (currently working on refactoring and making the code more usable, apologies for the terribly messy code)
