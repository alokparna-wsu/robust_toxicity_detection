It refers to \"\"the wing\"\", but what wing - I assume it is the 17th Bombardment Training Wing as detailed below the offending section, but this should be spelt out clearly; \\n * finally it will need a copy edit. \\n\\n Just a few ideas.

Looking at them, I thought for a long time that they seem to have separate ancestors, but since have gathered that current evidence shows all existant dogs decend from one single domestication event, somewhere in east Asia.  This evidence, however, indicates that there once were dogs that evolved at another place and time, but seem to have left no ancestors.   \"\n",

I would appeal to you to change your ways, to make up for this bullshit by maybe doing something to help others- but people like you never change. Truly. It sounds crazy, but without a doubt it is dishonest people who are the most reviled, unpopular, lonely figures. Think about it, people can be vain, violent, ugly, rude, timid, drunk, arrogant, or hysterical, and still have friends who overlook their flaws. Liars? Nobody is truly friends with someone they know to be a liar. They are social scum, tolerated at best, spoken ill of when not present. The romantic partners of liars grow to resent them, often leaving. The dishonest grow old lonely, resented by any family that still tolerates them, avoided by everyone else who can.

The program has reached a good audience since it was released and it is gaining in fame and notability.

You've also messed up the Cosmic Cube category formatting at the bottom of the article. \"\"Its\"\" is used to refer to the properties of an object, whereas \"\"it's\"\" means \"\"it is\"\". \"\"Multiversal scale\"\" is correct, as \"\"multiversal\"\" is an adjective regarding the noun \"\"scale\"\" while \"\"multiverse\"\" is a noun, which can't be used as such. The section you've been editing is extremely disproportionate to the rest of the sections.  is an extremely run-on sentence.  is somewhat redundant. Anything you want to add, ?  \"\n",

The source of the Brankovacka reka, its tributary, is on the border of Serbia and Macedonia, and a small area (not more than few square kilometers) of its drainage area is within Macedonia. So I thought it should be noted. However, my map is detailed but old, and it is possible that after corrections of the border in the 1990's, the borderline leaves all of it within Serbia (which, if you look at the map, would be natural).

And why is hip-hop emphasized?  If this article is going to be valuable, it needs to cover things like Duran Duran's \"\"Girls on Film\"\" and Motley Crue's \"\"Girls Girls Girls\"\".  Madonna and her wannabe followers (Britney Spears, ect.) need to be covered.  The rampant sexualization of young girls needs to be covered.  Most of all, this article needs some balance  some mention of the many people who find this a cheap, exploitative trend  a way for big bizness to stablize the market: instead of taking chances with art and creativity (when they're so out of touch with actual music making they can't tell a hit from a shit) they cynically wipe the field clean of real (unreliable, difficult to manage) artists and pump the world full of guaranteed-to-get-a-reaction pornography soundtracked by freeze-dried zombie music and performed by circus-trained money-hungry strippers who are no longer expected to even sing on stage.  The commodification of music is fueled by the increasing emphasis on sexuality and SEX SEX SEX is the number one reason big bizness music is both omnipresent and creatively bankrupt.  If I can find the time I will improve this article, just because it pissed me off so much.  I hope others will join me.  (Personally, I enjoy music AND pornography.  But the exploitation of both results in DEAD PRODUCT.  I can neither jerk off nor rock out to this zombie crap.  And I fear this crap is eating a hole in the souls of our young people.  It's all so creepy it cannot be dismissed as \"\"Okay\"\" and \"\"Not hurting anybody\"\" and \"\"Who cares?\"\"  Fuck the music biz and fuck this article, as it stands).   \"\n",

We're not here for an education in how trivial you think it is to treat another person with dignity even though they don't live up to your standards. There's no need to dismiss someone like that, not because we're all looking for the fainting couch but because it's designed to be maximally dismissive and provocative. You told someone they weren't worth listening to in the first comment. It's completely fine to tell someone their opinion needs to be backed up with evidence but there's no reason to do so like you did. It demeans any sense of level debate and coarsens things needlessly. Sure, if someone is pissing you off or not getting the point, responding like you did would be perfectly reasonable! We will all be blunt and discourteous when we're in a rush or egged on or whatever. In that context, what you said above is pretty tame (even around here). But you seemed to assume that posture the instant someone made an assertion you didn't like. If they felt they were making a reasonable contribution to the discussion (a comment such as theirs is pretty common in RfCs and elsewhere), then what were they to think when you reacted as you did? Should they have thanked you for your implicit education in how tough the real world is by comparison? Maybe leaving the discussion or ignoring the slight is easier. I certainly understand why people you've treated like crap wouldn't readily confront you about it. What would they gain from doing so? All I'm saying is don't be a jerk.    \n",

But I was kind of hoping that the facts concerning the certificates, which are put on Genseipedia as evidence, would clear up a few things for you. But I guess there is no hope for you ever to read or accept facts and evidence, even like now, when they are thrown in your face. Like I said, you don't have to agree with me, but you cannot disregard facts, if you are serious about writing the truth. But you ARE disregarding the facts, even when evidence and the people involved are putting the stories and evidence right up in your face. THAT is indeed a pity. So stop your slandering and accusations, because YOU are the only one doing that. I guess you are too blind to see the trees, as the forest is in your way? Unbelievable.\n",

It's always a complete mystery to me that with so many truly dreadful pages to chose from, people who consider themselves intelligent choose to spend years of their lives trawling Wikipedia' finest in order to nit-pick rather than doing something useful and constructive.
